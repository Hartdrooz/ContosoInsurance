# ContosoInsurance

This sample app is based on ContosoInsurance from Microsoft that you can find at this [link](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ContosoInsurance).

I refactored the application using modern cloud technologies using Blazor, Azure Function Core 2.0 and hosting everything inside Kubernetes Services.

This code doesn't come with any guarantee for production release.
